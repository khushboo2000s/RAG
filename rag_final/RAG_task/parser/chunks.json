        "1Introduction\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is \nissuing this advisory to assist financial institutions in detecting \npotentially illicit transactions related to Islamic Republic of \nIran (Iran)-backed terrorist organizations amid intensified \nterrorist activity in the Middle East.1  Recent events have \nunderscored Iran\u2019s involvement in and financing of terrorist \nactivity in the region.  Iran seeks, among other goals, to project \npower by exporting terrorism throughout the Middle East and \nbeyond through the financing of a range of regional armed \ngroups, some of which are U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorist \norganizations (SDGTs).2  These terrorist organizations include Lebanese Hizballah (Hizballah),3 Hamas,4 \n1. In 2018, FinCEN published an advisory on Iran\u2019s exploitation of the international financial system, which continues \nto serve as an additional resource for financial institutions in identifying suspicious activity related to Iran.  See \nFinCEN, \u201c Advisory on the Iranian Regime\u2019s Illicit and Malign Activities and Attempts to Exploit the Financial \nSystem \u201d (\u201cOct. 2018 FinCEN Advisory\u201d) (Oct. 11, 2018).  While the Oct. 2018 FinCEN Advisory and this advisory \naddress U.S. sanctions that prohibit U.S. persons and U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities from engaging in \ntransactions involving Iran, including persons \u201cordinarily resident\u201d in Iran, financial institutions should note that \nsome transactions involving Iran, Iranian citizens, or persons with connections to Iran, including certain humanitarian \ntransactions, may be authorized by general or specific license or exempt from sanctions prohibitions.  Institutions \nshould regard an Iranian nexus and the typologies listed in this advisory as factors to consider when assessing \nwhether any specific transaction or activity has an illicit nexus or is otherwise prohibited.\n2.

As demonstrated by the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and recent Houthi \nattacks in the Red Sea,7 these organizations are capable of perpetrating horrific violence, causing \ndestruction, and disrupting critical supply chains.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) \nhas been systematically working to dismantle these organizations by disrupting their illicit finance \nnetworks and eliminating their sources of revenue.8   \nThis advisory highlights the means by which terrorist organizations receive support from Iran \nand describes several typologies these terrorist organizations use to illicitly access or circumvent \nthe international financial system to raise, move, and spend funds.  It also provides red flags that \nmay assist financial institutions in identifying related suspicious activity and is consistent with \nFinCEN\u2019s National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/\nCFT) Priorities, which include terrorist financing.9    \nThe information contained in this advisory is derived from FinCEN\u2019s analysis of Bank Secrecy Act \n(BSA) data, open-source reporting, and information provided by law enforcement partners.\nHow Iran Raises and Moves Funds in Support of Terrorism \nIran supports its numerous terrorist partners and proxies through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard \nCorps (IRGC), a parallel organization to Iran\u2019s regular armed forces.10  In particular, the IRGC \ndivision known as the IRGC-Qods Force (IRGC-QF)11 is responsible for conducting covert lethal \nactivities outside of Iran, such as supporting terrorism globally and serving as a conduit for funds, \ntraining, and weapons to Iran-aligned partners and proxies.12   \n5.

Until October 2023, Hamas levied taxes on commodities, \nimports, and businesses operating in Gaza, and charged fees for licenses, birth certificates, customs \nduties, and vehicles.35  This source of revenue has effectively disappeared since the October 7, 2023, \nattacks on Israel and ongoing armed conflict in Gaza, leaving Hamas largely dependent on support \nfrom Iran, crowdfunding contributions, and whatever revenue the group can generate from its \ninvestment portfolio.36  \nHamas and its armed element, the Al-Qassam Brigades, have received support from Iran since the \n1990s37 through networks of corporations, banks, and individuals located in multiple countries, \nincluding the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria (Algeria), the Republic of Lebanon \n(Lebanon), the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia), the Republic of Sudan (Sudan), the \nRepublic of T\u00fcrkiye (T\u00fcrkiye), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), that help transfer money \n30.

To date, Treasury has targeted nearly 1,000 individuals and entities connected to terrorism and terrorist \nfinancing by the Government of Iran and its proxies, including Hamas, Hizballah, and other Iran-aligned terrorist \ngroups in the region.  See Department of State, Press Statement by Antony Blinken, U.S. Secretary of State, \u201c Designating \nHamas Operatives and Financial Facilitators - United States Department of State \u201d (Oct. 18, 2023).

See Feb. 2024 Terrorism Risk Assessment, supra note 9 at p. 24.  Treasury remains committed to denying Hamas \naccess to funds following its heinous terrorist attacks against the people of Israel, while also ensuring legitimate \nhumanitarian aid can continue to flow to the Palestinian people in Gaza.  To that end, and consistent with \nlongstanding policy to issue general licenses to authorize transactions in support of humanitarian relief efforts, OF AC \nauthorizes limited transactions with blocked persons to the extent such dealings are ordinarily incident and necessary \nto certain humanitarian activity.  See OFAC, \u201c Guidance for the Provision of Humanitarian Assistance to the People of \nGaza \u201d (\u201cNov. 2023 OFAC Compliance Communique\u201d) (Nov. 14, 2023).\n42. For example, shortly after the October 7, 2023, attacks, the pro-Hamas news outlet Gaza Now  began disseminating \nfundraising information on social media.  Cloaked in the language of humanitarian aid, these fundraisers mislead \ndonors as to the end use of their contributions, which were ultimately funneled to Hamas.  These campaigns solicited \ndonations in dollars, euros, and cryptocurrency and touched the U.S. and European banking systems.  Other recent \ncrowdfunding campaigns intended to support Hamas include those set up by the U.K.-based Al-Qureshi Executives, \nthe U.K.- and T\u00fcrkiye-based Al Khair Foundation, and Kudus Vakfi, an NGO based in T\u00fcrkiye and run by senior \nleadership of the U.S.-sanctioned Al Aqsa Foundation.  See Oct. 2023 Levitt Testimony, supra  note 35 at p. 8.\n43. According to FinCEN analysis of BSA information, between January 2020 and October 2023, financial institutions \nreported approximately $165 million in suspicious activity filings related to Hamas and CVC involving ov er 200 \nunique CVC addresses.  Given that filing institutions frequently attribute the full value of a customer\u2019s transactions\u2014\nincluding both fiat and CVC activity\u2014to Hamas, even when only a portion of the reported activity may be related, \nthe reported value is likely an overestimate.FINCEN ADVISORY82019,44  and has historically leveraged VASPs in an attempt to safeguard the anonymity of their \ndonors.45  There is evidence, however, that Hamas has reacted to law enforcement action targeting \nits use of CVC.

Today, the Houthis control a large \nportion of northern Yemen, including the former capital, Sana\u2019a.48   \nFollowing the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, the Houthis began attacking commercial \nand naval vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.  Since October 17, 2023, the Houthis have \ncarried out more than 50 attacks on commercial vessels, forcing companies to divert their shipments \nto the much costlier route around Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope.49  In response, the U.S. Department of \nState redesignated the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global T errorist (SDGT), effective February \n16, 2024.50  The United States has also responded by launching Operation Prosperity Guardian, a \nnaval coalition of more than 20 countries to protect commercial vessels;51  by leading a coalition that \nhas conducted a series of strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen;52 and by imposing sanctions against \nthe exchange houses and smuggling network through which Iran funds the Houthis.53  \n44. In August 2020, the DOJ, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Treasury, and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal \nInvestigations (IRS-CI) collaborated to dismantle three Bitcoin funding campaigns benefiting terrorist organizations, \nincluding one initiated by Hamas\u2019 al-Qassam Brigades.  The fundraiser was advertised using social media and the al-\nQassam website and falsely claimed that Bitcoin contributions were untraceable.  U.S. authorities seized the website \ninfrastructure and all 150 Bitcoin wallets that had helped launder the funds and charged two foreign nationals with \nmoney laundering in connection with the campaign.

Those \nfunds are then funneled to the Houthis in Yemen through a complex network of exchanges and \nintermediaries spread across multiple countries.  Al-Jamal also maintains connections to Hizballah \nand has worked with the group to send millions of dollars to benefit the Houthis.54  The Houthis \nalso raise funds by collecting customs revenue from the Hudaydah and Salif ports in Yemen, \nappropriating public funds using fraudulent contracts, and unlawfully appropriating assets \nbelonging to political opponents or those who have fled the country.55    \nHizballah\nFormed in the wake of Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Hizballah is a strategic partner through \nwhich Iran projects power throughout the Middle East.  While primarily based in Lebanon, \nHizballah\u2019s activities extend to Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.56  Iran has provided hundreds of millions \nof dollars in support to Hizballah and has trained thousands of its fighters at camps in Iran.  \nHizballah in turn has trained and equipped other Iran-aligned militias in the region and acts as a \nconduit for funds from Iran\u2019s IRGC-QF to other Iran-aligned groups.57  \nEstimates indicate that Iran has historically provided Hizballah with approximately $700 million \nof Hizballah\u2019s estimated $1 billion annual budget.58  While Iran has supported Hizballah and \nothers through a vast network of front companies, banks, and individuals,59 Hizballah also finances \nitself through a broad range of illicit activities, including oil smuggling,60 money laundering, drug \ntrafficking,61 counterfeiting, and illegal weapons procurement.62  These activities are global in scale, \n54.

In 2023, Treasury \nsanctioned the Al-Ansar Charity Foundation and the Muhjat al-Quds Foundation, through which \nIran provided financial support to PIJ fighters and their families.73   \nIran-aligned Militia Groups in Iraq and Syria \nSome of the most prominent Iran-aligned militia groups in Iraq are Kata\u2019ib Hizballah (KH),74   \nKata\u2019ib Sayyid al Shuhada (KSS),75 Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH),76 and Harakat al-Nujaba (HaN).77   \nThese groups have received support, training, weapons, and intelligence from the IRGC-QF and \nHizballah.  These groups have also abused the Iraqi financial system to generate revenue and \nlaunder money, including through the use of front companies, fraudulent documentation, identity \ntheft, currency arbitrage, and counterfeit currency.78  Although some members of Iran-aligned \nmilitia groups operate within Iraq\u2019s official Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), these groups \nfrequently operate outside government control and conduct destabilizing attacks in Iraq and \nneighboring Syria79 as well as attacks against coalition forces seeking to defeat the Islamic State of \nIraq and Syria (ISIS).80  \n72.
